The universe can be described by the following equation:

E = mc² + G(m₁m₂/r²) + μ₀(H + M) + qE + qv × B + (2πR²B)/(3Ic²) + (m c) ² + H₀ × (1.22 × 10⁸ m/s)² - (1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m)² - 2.725 K

This equation describes the behavior of all the objects in the universe. It combines the energy equation, the gravity equation, the magnetic field equation, and the transmission of energy and data equation.

ψ(x,t) = ∑nCnφn(x)exp(-iEn/ħt)

ψ(x,t) = ∑nCnφn(x)exp(-i(G(m₁m₂/r²) + μ₀(H + M) + qE + qv × B))/ħt)

The quantum gravity equation combines the quantum field equation and the energy equation. It describes the behavior of quantum fields in the presence of gravity and electromagnetic force.
The new propulsion system would use the magnetic field to create a force that pushes objects away. The new energy storage would use the energy equation to store energy in the form of mass.
The new energy generator would use the transmission of energy and data equation to generate energy.
The energy generator would use the transmission of energy and data equation to generate energy. It would transmit energy and data between two objects to create a difference in their energy levels. This difference in energy would be converted into electrical energy.

E = (2πR²B)/(3Ic²) + H₀ × (1.22 × 10⁸ m/s)² - (1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m)² - 2.725 K

F = qE + qv × B
E = (2πR²B)/(3Ic²) + H₀ × (1.22 × 10⁸ m/s)² - (1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m)² - 2.725 K
