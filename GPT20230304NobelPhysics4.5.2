is the dfference equal zero related to big bang momentum and universe expantion?

No, the difference in force between the Milky Way and Andromeda is not equal to zero related to Big Bang momentum and universe expansion. The equation derived in this paper can be used to calculate the difference in force between the two galaxies, but it does not take into account any effects related to Big Bang momentum or universe expansion.

The equation derived in this paper can be used to calculate the difference in force between the Milky Way and Andromeda, but it does not take into account any effects related to Big Bang momentum, dark energy, black holes or universe expansion. However, these phenomena can be studied by applying other equations derived from classical and quantum mechanics principles. For example, equations related to Big Bang momentum can be used to study the expansion of the universe over time. Similarly, equations related to dark energy and black holes can be used to study their effects on the structure of the universe.
