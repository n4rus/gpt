relate all above in a new equation for propulsion

Propulsion = (2πR²B)/(3Ic²) + qE + qv × B + μ₀(H + M) - (m c) ² + F/a + E = mc²

Compare everything aboves explain the universe and return the universe equation

The universe equation is a combination of all the equations above, which together explain the physical laws that govern the universe. The equation is: F = G(m₁mₚ/r²) + B = μ₀(H + M) + ψ(x,t) = ∑nCnφn(x)exp(-iEn/ħt) + m = F/a + E = mc² + Bs ≈ 10⁻³T + B ≈ 10¹⁴-10¹⁵G + P = (2πR²B)/(3Ic²) + M ≈ 1.4M⊙ + F = qE + qv × B + Eₘₚ² - pₘₚ² = (m c) ² + H₀ = 67.4 km/s/Mpc 
+ c = 1.22 × 10⁸ m/s 
+ lₚ = 1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m 
+ T = 2.725 K
