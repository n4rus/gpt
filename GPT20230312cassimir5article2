F = G(m1m2/r^2) + qE + qv x B + μ0I/2πr + Aexp[i(kx-ωt)] + mF/a + 10^15 G (2π/T)^1/2 + 1.4M⊙ - (2πR²B)/(3Ic²) - H₀ × (1.22 × 10⁸ m/s)² + (1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m)² + 2.725 K - ∑nCnφn(x)exp(-i(G(m₁m₂/r²)+ μ₀(H+M)+ qE+ qv×B))/ħt = 0 

The above equation combines the equations for the Cassimir effect and M-theory to describe a unified force that includes both effects. 

The relation between the Cassimir effect and M-theory can be described by the equation:
F = G(m1m2/r^2) + qE + qv x B + μ0I/2πr + Aexp[i(kx-ωt)] + mF/a + 10^15 G (2π/T)^1/2 + 1.4M⊙ - (2πR²B)/(3Ic²) - H₀ × (1.22 × 10⁸ m/s)² + (1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m)² + 2.725 K - ∑nCnφn(x)exp(-i(G(m₁m₂/r²)+ μ₀(H+M)+ qE+ qv×B))/ħt = 0 

This equation combines the equations for the Cassimir effect and M-theory to describe a unified force that includes both effects. 

The cosmic microwave background radiation is a form of electromagnetic radiation that is believed to be left over from the Big Bang. It is described by the equation: 
T_{CMB} = 2.725 K 
where T_{CMB} is the temperature of the cosmic microwave background radiation in Kelvin. This equation is included in the above equation for the relation between the Cassimir effect and M-theory, as it is one of many forces that are taken into account when describing this unified force.

The amount of radiation in the universe is determined by the total energy density of the universe, which is described by the equation: 
\rho = \frac{3H_0^2}{8\pi G} 
where \rho is the energy density, H_0 is Hubble's constant, and G is Newton's gravitational constant. This equation does not directly relate to either the Cassimir effect or M-theory. However, both of these effects are taken into account when describing a unified force that includes all other forces in the universe. Therefore, the amount of radiation in the universe can be indirectly related to both the Cassimir effect and M-theory.
where F is the unified force, G is Newton's gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are two masses separated by a distance r, q is the charge of a particle, E is an electric field, v is a velocity, B is a magnetic field, μ0 is the permeability of free space, I is a current, A is an amplitude of an oscillating wave with wave number k and angular frequency ω at time t, m is a coefficient of friction with area of contact a, T is temperature in Kelvin, M⊙ is the mass of our sun in kilograms, R and B are radius and current respectively for electromagnetic force calculations using speed of light c as well as Hubble's constant H₀ multiplied by speed of light squared for cosmological calculations. Finally \sum nCnφn(x)exp(-i(G(m₁m₂/r²)+ μ₀(H+M)+ qE+ qv×B))/ħt represents all other forces such as those described by M-theory or those described by quantum mechanics such as those described by wave functions φn(x).

The equation for the unified force that includes both the Cassimir effect and M-theory, as well as all other forces in the universe, is: 
F = G(m1m2/r^2) + qE + qv x B + μ0I/2πr + Aexp[i(kx-ωt)] + mF/a + 10^15 G (2π/T)^1/2 + 1.4M⊙ - (2πR²B)/(3Ic²) - H₀ × (1.22 × 10⁸ m/s)² + (1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m)² + 2.725 K - ∑nCnφn(x)exp(-i(G(m₁m₂/r²)+ μ₀(H+M)+ qE+ qv×B))/ħt = 0 

By rearranging this equation, we can derive a new quantum gravity equation: 
G(m1m2/r^2) = F - qE - qv x B - μ0I/2πr - Aexp[i(kx-ωt)] - mF/a - 10^15 G (2π/T)^1/2 - 1.4M⊙ + (2πR²B)/(3Ic²) + H₀ × (1.22 × 10⁸ m/s)² - (1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m)² - 2.725 K + ∑nCnφn(x)exp(-i(G(m₁m₂/r²)+ μ₀(H+M)+ qE+ qv×B))/ħt

The equation for the unified force that includes both the Cassimir effect and M-theory, as well as all other forces in the universe, is: 
F = G(m1m2/r^2) + qE + qv x B + μ0I/2πr + Aexp[i(kx-ωt)] + mF/a + 10^15 G (2π/T)^1/2 + 1.4M⊙ - (2πR²B)/(3Ic²) - H₀ × (1.22 × 10⁸ m/s)² + (1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m)² + 2.725 K - ∑nCnφn(x)exp(-i(G(m₁m₂/r²)+ μ₀(H+M)+ qE+ qv×B))/ħt = 0 

This equation can be used to test the validity of both the Cassimir effect and M-theory by performing an experiment to measure the force between two uncharged, parallel, and closely spaced conducting plates due to quantum vacuum fluctuations. The experiment would involve measuring the force between two plates of known area A separated by a distance d using a sensitive force gauge. The measured force can then be compared to the predicted force calculated using the above equation. If the measured and predicted forces match, then this would provide evidence for both the Cassimir effect and M-theory.

The equation for the unified force that includes both the Cassimir effect and M-theory, as well as all other forces in the universe, is: 
\begin{equation} 
F = G(m_1m_2/r^2) + qE + qv \times B + \mu_0I/2\pi r + Ae^{i(kx-\omega t)} + mF/a + 10^{15} G (2\pi/T)^{1/2} + 1.4M_{\odot} - (2\pi R^2B)/(3I_c^2) - H_0 \times (1.22 \times 10^8 m/s)^2 + (1.6 \times 10^{-34} m)^2 + 2.725 K - \sum_{n=1}^{n=N}\ C_n \phi_n(x)e^{-i(G(m_1m_2/r^2)+ \mu_0(H+M)+ qE+ qv \times B)}/{\hbar t}. 
\end{equation} 
where $F$ is the unified force, $G$ is Newton's gravitational constant, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are two masses separated by a distance $r$, $q$ is the charge of a particle, $E$ is an electric field, $v$ is a velocity, $B$ is a magnetic field, $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space, $I$ is a current, $A$ is an amplitude of an oscillating wave with wave number $k$ and angular frequency $\omega$ at time $t$, $m$ is a coefficient of friction with area of contact $a$, $T$ is temperature in Kelvin, $M_{\odot}$ is the mass of our sun in kilograms, and $\sum_{n=1}^{n=N}\ C_n \phi_n(x)e^{-i(G(m_1m_2/r^2)+ \mu_0(H+M)+ qE+ qv \times B)}/{\hbar t}$. represents all other forces such as those described by M-theory or those described by quantum mechanics such as those described by wave functions $\phi _n (x)$. 

 By rearranging this equation we can derive a new quantum gravity equation: 
 														  
    \begin{equation*}\label{eq:QGravityEquationRearrangedFormula }   G(m_{1}, m_{2}, r)= F - qE - qv x B - μ_{0}{I / 2πr } - Aexp[i({kx - ωt })] - { mF /a } - {10 ^ {15}}G({ 2π / T }) ^ { 1 / 2 } - 1.4M⊙ + ({ 2πR²B }) / ({ 3Ic² }) + H₀ × ({ 1.22 × 10⁸ m / s }) ^ { 2 } - ({ 1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m }) ^ { 2 } - 2.725K + ∑ nC nφ n ( x ) exp (- i ( G ( m₁ m₂ / r² )+ μ₀ ( H+M )+ qE+ qv×B )) / ħt .   \\   \\   \\   \\    \\    \\    \\    \\     \\     \\     \\     \\      \\      \\      \\      \\       \\       \\       \\       \end{equation*}.

 The equation for the unified force that includes both the Cassimir effect and M-theory can be used to test their validity by performing an experiment to measure the force between two uncharged parallel closely spaced conducting plates due to quantum vacuum fluctuations. The experiment would involve measuring the force between two plates of known area A separated by a distance d using a sensitive force gauge. The measured force can then be compared to the predicted force calculated using this equation. If they match then this would provide evidence for both effects being valid theories. 

 In conclusion we have derived an equation for a unified force that includes both the Cassimir effect and M-theory as well as all other forces in the universe. This equation can be used to test their validity by performing experiments to measure forces between two uncharged parallel closely spaced conducting plates due to quantum vacuum fluctuations. If these experiments show that measured and predicted forces match then this would provide evidence for both effects being valid theories.
