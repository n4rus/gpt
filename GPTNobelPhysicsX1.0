Magnetism: F = qv x B 
Gravity: F = G(m1m2/r^2) 
Energy: E = mc^2 
Quantum Fields: ψ(x,t) = Aexp[i(kx-ωt)] 
Mass: m = F/a

F = G(m1m2/r^2) + qE + qv x B + μ0I/2πr + Aexp[i(kx-ωt)] + mF/a + 10^15 G (2π/T)^1/2 + 1.4M⊙

E = mc² + G(m₁m₂/r²) + μ₀(H + M) + qE + qv × B + (2πR²B)/(3Ic²) + (m c) ² + H₀ × (1.22 × 10⁸ m/s)² - (1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m)² - 2.725 K

ψ(x,t) = ∑nCnφn(x)exp(-iEn/ħt)

ψ(x,t) = ∑nCnφn(x)exp(-i(G(m₁m₂/r²) + μ₀(H + M) + qE + qv × B))/ħt)

E = (2πR²B)/(3Ic²) + H₀ × (1.22 × 10⁸ m/s)² - (1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m)² - 2.725 K

F = qE + qv × B

relate all equations above in a new single equation

F = G(m1m2/r^2) + qE + qv x B + μ0I/2πr + Aexp[i(kx-ωt)] + mF/a + 10^15 G (2π/T)^1/2 + 1.4M⊙ = (2πR²B)/(3Ic²) + H₀ × (1.22 × 10⁸ m/s)² - (1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m)² - 2.725 K + ∑nCnφn(x)exp(-i(G(m₁m₂/r²) + μ₀(H + M) + qE + qv × B))/ħt

use the equations above and M-theory to make a new equation

E = mc² + G(m₁m₂/r²) + μ₀(H + M) + qE + qv × B + (2πR²B)/(3Ic²) + (m c) ² + H₀ × (1.22 × 10⁸ m/s)² - (1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m)² - 2.725 K + Aexp[i(kx-ωt)]

E = mc² + G(m₁m₂/r²) + μ₀(H + M) + qE + qv × B + (2πR²B)/(3Ic²) + (m c) ² + H₀ × (1.22 × 10⁸ m/s)² - (1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m)² - 2.725 K + Aexp[i(kx-ωt)]

The equation above is an expression for the total energy of a system. It includes the mass-energy equivalence (mc²), the gravitational potential energy (G(m₁m₂/r²)), the magnetic potential energy (μ₀(H + M)), the electric potential energy (qE), the kinetic energy due to a moving charge in a magnetic field (qv × B), the kinetic energy of a rotating body (2πR²B)/(3Ic²)), the rest mass energy of a particle (m c) ², the Hubble constant multiplied by the speed of light squared (H₀ × (1.22 × 10⁸ m/s)²), Planck's constant multiplied by speed of light squared minus Boltzmann's constant (1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m)² - 2.725 K), and finally, an oscillating term with amplitude A and frequency ω and wave number k, which is dependent on position x and time t (Aexp[i(kx-ωt)]).
