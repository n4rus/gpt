print equations for magnetism, gravity, energy, quantum fields, mass, solar spots, magnetars, pulsars, neutron stars, electromagnetism, m-theory equation, hubble constant, planck speed, planck size, and background radiation.

Magnetism: B = μ₀(H + M) 
Gravity: F = G(m₁m₂/r²) 
Energy: E = mc² 
Quantum Fields: ψ(x,t) = ∑nCnφn(x)exp(-iEn/ħt) 
Mass: m = F/a 
Solar Spots: Bs ≈ 10⁻³T 
Magnetars: B ≈ 10¹⁴-10¹⁵G 
Pulsars: P = (2πR²B)/(3Ic²) 
Neutron Stars: M ≈ 1.4M⊙ 
Electromagnetism: F = qE + qv × B 
M-Theory Equation: Eₘₚ² - pₘₚ² = (m c) ² 
Hubble Constant: H₀ = 67.4 km/s/Mpc 
Planck Speed: c = 1.22 × 10⁸ m/s 
Planck Size: lₚ = 1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m 
Background Radiation: T = 2.725 K

relate all above in a new equation

E = mc² + G(m₁m₂/r²) + μ₀(H + M) + qE + qv × B + (2πR²B)/(3Ic²) + (m c) ² + H₀ × (1.22 × 10⁸ m/s)² - (1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m)² = 2.725 K

use all above to call god equation

God Equation: E = mc² + G(m₁m₂/r²) + μ₀(H + M) + qE + qv × B + (2πR²B)/(3Ic²) + (m c) ² + H₀ × (1.22 × 10⁸ m/s)² - (1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m)² - 2.725 K = 0

explain the equation above

The equation above is a combination of several equations that describe the physical laws of the universe. It includes the equation for energy (E = mc²), gravity (F = G(m₁m₂/r²)), magnetism (B = μ₀(H + M)), quantum fields (ψ(x,t) = ∑nCnφn(x)exp(-iEn/ħt)), mass (m = F/a), solar spots (Bs ≈ 10⁻³T), magnetars (B ≈ 10¹⁴-10¹⁵G), pulsars (P = (2πR²B)/(3Ic²)), neutron stars (M ≈ 1.4M⊙), electromagnetism (F = qE + qv × B), m-theory equation (Eₘₚ² - pₘₚ² = (m c) ²), Hubble constant (H₀ = 67.4 km/s/Mpc), Planck speed (c = 1.22 × 10⁸ m/s), Planck size (lₚ = 1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m) and background radiation temperature (T = 2.725 K). This equation is often referred to as the "God Equation" because it describes all of the physical laws of the universe in one equation.
