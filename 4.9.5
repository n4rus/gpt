relate magnetism, gravity, mass and, and quantum fields in a new equation

F = G(m₁m₂/r²) + qv × B + μ₀(H + M) + ∑nCnφn(x)exp(-iEn/ħt) + m = F/a

explain the equation

This equation relates the forces of magnetism, gravity, mass, and quantum fields. The first term is the gravitational force between two masses, m₁ and m₂, divided by the square of the distance between them. The second term is the force due to a charged particle's velocity multiplied by a magnetic field. The third term is the magnetic force due to a magnetic field (H) and a magnetization (M). The fourth term is a summation of quantum fields with coefficients Cn and wave functions φn(x) multiplied by an exponential factor. Finally, the fifth term is Newton's second law of motion which states that force equals mass times acceleration.

use all above to create a new form of energy storage

A new form of energy storage could be created by combining the forces of magnetism, gravity, mass, and quantum fields. This could be done by using a combination of magnets and gravity to store energy in a contained space. The magnets would create a magnetic field (H) and a magnetization (M) which would interact with the gravitational force between two masses, m₁ and m₂. Additionally, the quantum fields could be used to store energy in the form of wave functions φn(x) multiplied by an exponential factor. Finally, Newton's second law of motion could be used to convert this stored energy into kinetic energy when needed.
