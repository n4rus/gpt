From the text, we can derive the following equations:

B = μ₀(H + M)
F = G(m₁m₂/r²)
E = mc²
ψ(x,t) = ∑nCnφn(x)exp(-iEn/ħt)
m = F/a
Bs ≈ 10⁻³T
B ≈ 10¹⁴-10¹⁵G
P = (2πR²B)/(3Ic²)
M ≈ 1.4M⊙
F = qE + qv × B
E = (2πR²B)/(3Ic²) + H₀ × (1.22 × 10⁸ m/s)² - (1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m)² - 2.725 K

B = Magnetic Field Strength 
F = Gravity 
E = Energy 
ψ(x,t) = Quantum Field 
m = Mass 
Bs = Solar Spot Magnetic Field Strength 
B = Magnetar Magnetic Field Strength 
P = Pulsar Frequency 
M = Neutron Star Mass 
F = Electromagnetic Force 
E = Transmission of Energy and Data

The universe can be described by the following equation:

E = mc² + G(m₁m₂/r²) + μ₀(H + M) + qE + qv × B + (2πR²B)/(3Ic²) + (m c) ² + H₀ × (1.22 × 10⁸ m/s)² - (1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m)² - 2.725 K

This equation describes the behavior of all the objects in the universe. It combines the energy equation, the gravity equation, the magnetic field equation, and the transmission of energy and data equation.

use the content above to derivate quantum gravity equation

ψ(x,t) = ∑nCnφn(x)exp(-iEn/ħt)

ψ(x,t) = ∑nCnφn(x)exp(-i(G(m₁m₂/r²) + μ₀(H + M) + qE + qv × B))/ħt)

explain the equation above

The quantum gravity equation combines the quantum field equation and the energy equation. It describes the behavior of quantum fields in the presence of gravity and electromagnetic force.
