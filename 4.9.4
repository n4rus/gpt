relate magnetism, gravity, mass and, and quantum fields in a new equation

F = G(m₁m₂/r²) + qv × B + μ₀(H + M) + ∑nCnφn(x)exp(-iEn/ħt) + m = F/a

explain the equation

This equation relates the forces of magnetism, gravity, mass, and quantum fields. The first term is the gravitational force between two masses, m₁ and m₂, divided by the square of the distance between them. The second term is the force due to a charged particle's velocity multiplied by a magnetic field. The third term is the magnetic force due to a magnetic field (H) and a magnetization (M). The fourth term is a summation of quantum fields with coefficients Cn and wave functions φn(x) multiplied by an exponential factor. Finally, the fifth term is Newton's second law of motion which states that force equals mass times acceleration.

use all above to create a new form of energy generation

A new form of energy generation could be created by combining the forces of magnetism, gravity, mass, and quantum fields. This could be done by using a combination of magnets and charged particles to create a magnetic field, which would then interact with the gravitational force between two masses. The quantum fields could be used to generate energy from the wave functions and coefficients. Finally, Newton's second law of motion could be used to convert the generated energy into kinetic energy. This kinetic energy could then be used to power various devices or machines.
