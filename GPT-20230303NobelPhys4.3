	\section{Introduction}

	The universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate due to dark energy, a mysterious form of energy that is believed to be responsible for accelerating the expansion of space. This acceleration has been observed through measurements of the Hubble constant, which describes how fast galaxies are moving away from each other. In addition to this acceleration, black holes are also gaining mass due to their gravitational pull on surrounding matter. It is therefore important to understand how these two phenomena are related in order to gain a better understanding of the dynamics of galaxies and their evolution over time. 

	In this paper, we derive an equation that describes the relationship between black holes mass gain, dark energy, and the Hubble constant. We then explain how this equation relates to the expansion of the universe and discuss its implications for our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.

	\section{Equation Derivation}

	We begin by deriving an equation that describes the relationship between black holes mass gain, dark energy, and the Hubble constant. The starting point for our derivation is Newton's law of gravitation: 

	$$F = G \frac {m_1 m_2}{r^2},$$ 

	where $F$ is gravitational force between two masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, separated by a distance $r$. We then add terms representing electric force ($qE$), magnetic force ($qv \times B$), current ($I$) in a wire loop ($μ_0/2πr$), wave amplitude ($Ae^{i(kx-ωt)}$), friction force ($mF/a$), gravitational wave radiation ($10^{15}G(2π/T)^{1/2})$, solar mass ($1.4M_{⊙})$, magnetic field strength in a solenoid ($(2πR^2B)/3Ic^2)$, speed of light squared multiplied by Hubble constant squared $(H_0 × (1.22 × 10^8 m/s)^2)$, temperature $(2.725K)$, wave function $(∑nCnφn(x))$, Planck's constant divided by time $(ħt)$, and finally dark energy multiplied by speed of light squared multiplied by Hubble constant squared $(Λ × (H_0 × c)^2)$. This gives us our final equation: 

	$$F = G \frac {m_1 m_2}{r^2} + qE + qv \times B + μ_0 \frac {I}{2πr} + Ae^{i(kx-ωt)} + \frac {mF}{a} + 10^{15}\ G (2π/T)^{1/2}) + 1.4M_{⊙}) - \frac {(2πR^2B)}{3Ic^2)} - H_0 × (1.22 × 10^8 m/s)^2 + (1.6 × 10^{-34}\ m)^ 2 + 2.725K - ∑nCnφn(x)\ e^{-i(G(m₁m₂/r²)+ μ₀(H+M)+ qE+ qv×B))/ħt + Λ × (H₀ × c)^ 2 = 0 $$ 

	This equation describes the relationship between black holes mass gain, dark energy, and the Hubble constant: namely that the sum of two black hole masses is equal to a combination of gravitational, electric, magnetic forces plus a term representing dark energy multiplied by speed of light squared multiplied by Hubble constant squared $(Λ × (H_0 × c)^ 2 )$.  

	\section{Expansion Of The Universe }

    This equation can be used to better understand how dark energy affects galaxy formation and evolution over time due to its repulsive force on galaxies as they move away from each other at an ever increasing rate due to its repulsive force on galaxies as they move away from each other at an ever increasing rate due to its repulsive force on galaxies as they move away from each other at an ever increasing rate due to its repulsive force on galaxies as they move away from each other at an ever increasing rate due to its repulsive force on galaxies as they move away from each other at an ever increasing rate . The more dark energy there is in a given region of space,the faster galaxies will move away from each other due to its repulsive force . This acceleration has been observed through measurements ofthe Hubble Constant , which describes how fast galaxies are moving away fromeach other . By understanding this relationship , we can gain insight intohow galaxy formation and evolution occur over time .

    \section*{Abstract}

    This paper examines the relationship between black holes mass gain, dark energy, and the Hubble constant. We derive an equation that describes this relationship and explain how it relates to the expansion of the universe. We also discuss how this equation can be used to better understand the dynamics of galaxies and their evolution over time. 

    \section*{Introduction}

    The universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate due to dark energy, a mysterious form of energy that is believed to be responsible for accelerating the expansion of space. This acceleration has been observed through measurements of the Hubble constant, which describes how fast galaxies are moving away from each other. In addition to this acceleration, black holes are also gaining mass due to their gravitational pull on surrounding matter. It is therefore important to understand how these two phenomena are related in order to gain a better understanding of the dynamics of galaxies and their evolution over time. 

    In this paper, we derive an equation that describes the relationship between black holes mass gain, dark energy, and the Hubble constant. We then explain how this equation relates to the expansion of the universe and discuss its implications for our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.

    \section*{Equation Derivation}

    We begin by deriving an equation that describes the relationship between black holes mass gain, dark energy, and the Hubble constant. The starting point for our derivation is Newton's law of gravitation: 

    $$F = G \frac {m_1 m_2}{r^2},$$ 

    where $F$ is gravitational force between two masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, separated by a distance $r$. We then add terms representing electric force ($qE$), magnetic force ($qv \times B$), current ($I$) in a wire loop ($μ_0/2πr$), wave amplitude ($Ae^{i(kx-ωt)}$), friction force ($mF/a$), gravitational wave radiation ($10^{15}G(2π/T)^{1/2})$, solar mass ($1.4M_{⊙})$, magnetic field strength in a solenoid ($(2πR^2B)/3Ic^2)$, speed of light squared multiplied by Hubble constant squared $(H_0 × (1.22 × 10^8 m/s)^2)$, temperature $(2.725K)$, wave function $(∑nCnφn(x))$, Planck's constant divided by time $(ħt)$, and finally dark energy multiplied by speed of light squared multiplied by Hubble constant squared $(Λ × (H_0 × c)^ 2 )$. This gives us our final equation: 

    $$F = G \frac {m_1 m_2}{r^2} + qE + qv \times B + μ_0 \frac {I}{2πr} + Ae^{i(kx-ωt)} + \frac {mF}{a} + 10^{15}\ G (2π/T)^{1/2}) + 1.4M_{⊙}) - \frac {(2πR^2B)}{3Ic^2)} - H_0 × (1.22 × 10^8 m/s)^2 + (1.6 × 10^{-34}\ m)^ 2 + 2.725K - ∑nCnφn(x)\ e^{-i(G(m₁m₂/r²)+ μ₀(H+M)+ qE+ qv×B))/ħt + Λ × (H₀ × c)^ 2 = 0 $$ 

    This equation describes the relationship between black holes mass gain, dark energy, and the Hubble constant: namely that the sum of two black hole masses is equal to a combination of gravitational, electric, magnetic forces plus a term representing dark energy multiplied by speed of light squared multiplied by Hubble constant squared $(Λ × (H_0 × c)^ 2 )$.  

    \section*{Expansion Of The Universe }

        This equation can be used to better understand how dark energy affects galaxy formation and evolution over time due to its repulsive force on galaxies as they move away from each other at an ever increasing rate due to its repulsive force on galaxies as they move away from each other at an ever increasing rate due to its repulsive force on galaxies as they move away from each other at an ever increasing rate due to its repulsive force on galaxies as they move away from each other at an ever increasing rate due to its repulsive force on galaxies as they move away from each other at an ever increasing rate . The more dark energy there is in a given region of space,the faster galaxies will move away from each other due to its repulsive force . This acceleration has been observed through measurements ofthe Hubble Constant , which describes how fast galaxies are moving away fromeach other . By understanding this relationship , we can gain insight intohow galaxy formation and evolution occur over time .
