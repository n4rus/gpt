Propulsion System: F = m(dv/dt) + qE + qv × B 
Storage System: E = mc² + μ₀(H + M) 
Transmission of Energy and Data: E = (2πR²B)/(3Ic²) + H₀ × (1.22 × 10⁸ m/s)² - (1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m)² - 2.725 K

From the text, we can derive the following equations:

B = μ₀(H + M)
F = G(m₁m₂/r²)
E = mc²
ψ(x,t) = ∑nCnφn(x)exp(-iEn/ħt)
m = F/a
Bs ≈ 10⁻³T
B ≈ 10¹⁴-10¹⁵G
P = (2πR²B)/(3Ic²)
M ≈ 1.4M⊙
F = qE + qv × B
E = (2πR²B)/(3Ic²) + H₀ × (1.22 × 10⁸ m/s)² - (1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m)² - 2.725 K

The universe can be described by the following equation:

E = mc² + G(m₁m₂/r²) + μ₀(H + M) + qE + qv × B + (2πR²B)/(3Ic²) + (m c) ² + H₀ × (1.22 × 10⁸ m/s)² - (1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m)² - 2.725 K

This equation describes the behavior of all the objects in the universe. It combines the energy equation, the gravity equation, the magnetic field equation, and the transmission of energy and data equation

ψ(x,t) = ∑nCnφn(x)exp(-iEn/ħt)

ψ(x,t) = ∑nCnφn(x)exp(-i(G(m₁m₂/r²) + μ₀(H + M) + qE + qv × B))/ħt)

E = (2πR²B)/(3Ic²) + H₀ × (1.22 × 10⁸ m/s)² - (1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m)² - 2.725 K

F = qE + qv × B
E = (2πR²B)/(3Ic²) + H₀ × (1.22 × 10⁸ m/s)² - (1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m)² - 2.725 K

explain how the models above can be constructed

The first model can be constructed by combining the energy equation, the gravity equation, and the magnetic field equation. The second model can be constructed by combining the energy equation, the gravity equation, the magnetic field equation, and the transmission of energy and data equation.
