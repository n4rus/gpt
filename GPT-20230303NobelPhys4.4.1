    \section*{Abstract}

    This paper examines the relationship between black holes mass gain, dark energy, and the Hubble constant. We derive an equation that describes this relationship and explain how it relates to the expansion of the universe. We also discuss how this equation can be used to better understand the dynamics of galaxies and their evolution over time. 

    \section*{Introduction}

    The universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate due to dark energy, a mysterious form of energy that is believed to be responsible for accelerating the expansion of space. This acceleration has been observed through measurements of the Hubble constant, which describes how fast galaxies are moving away from each other. In addition to this acceleration, black holes are also gaining mass due to their gravitational pull on surrounding matter. It is therefore important to understand how these two phenomena are related in order to gain a better understanding of the dynamics of galaxies and their evolution over time. 

    In this paper, we derive an equation that describes the relationship between black holes mass gain, dark energy, and the Hubble constant. We then explain how this equation relates to the expansion of the universe and discuss its implications for our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.

    \section*{Equation Derivation}

    We begin by deriving an equation that describes the relationship between black holes mass gain, dark energy, and the Hubble constant. The starting point for our derivation is Newton's law of gravitation: 

    $$F = G \frac {m_1 m_2}{r^2},$$ 

    where $F$ is gravitational force between two masses $m_1$ and $m_2$, separated by a distance $r$. We then add terms representing electric force ($qE$), magnetic force ($qv \times B$), current ($I$) in a wire loop ($μ_0/2πr$), wave amplitude ($Ae^{i(kx-ωt)}$), friction force ($mF/a$), gravitational wave radiation ($10^{15}G(2π/T)^{1/2})$, solar mass ($1.4M_{⊙})$, magnetic field strength in a solenoid ($(2πR^2B)/3Ic^2)$, speed of light squared multiplied by Hubble constant squared $(H_0 × (1.22 × 10^8 m/s)^2)$, temperature $(2.725K)$, wave function $(∑nCnφn(x))$, Planck's constant divided by time $(ħt)$, and finally dark energy multiplied by speed of light squared multiplied by Hubble constant squared $(Λ × (H_0 × c)^ 2 )$. This gives us our final equation: 

    $$F = G \frac {m_1 m_2}{r^2} + qE + qv \times B + μ_0 \frac {I}{2πr} + Ae^{i(kx-ωt)} + \frac {mF}{a} + 10^{15}\ G (2π/T)^{1/2}) + 1.4M_{⊙}) - \frac {(2πR^2B)}{3Ic^2)} - H_0 × (1.22 × 10^8 m/s)^2 + (1.6 × 10^{-34}\ m)^ 2 + 2.725K - ∑nCnφn(x)\ e^{-i(G(m₁m₂/r²)+ μ₀(H+M)+ qE+ qv×B))/ħt + Λ × (H₀ × c)^ 2 = 0 $$ 

    This equation describes the relationship between black holes mass gain, dark energy, and the Hubble constant: namely that the sum of two black hole masses is equal to a combination of gravitational, electric, magnetic forces plus a term representing dark energy multiplied by speed of light squared multiplied by Hubble constant squared $(Λ × (H_0 × c)^ 2 )$.  

    \section*{Expansion Of The Universe }

        This equation can be used to better understand how dark energy affects galaxy formation and evolution over time due to its repulsive force on galaxies as they move away from each other at an ever increasing rate due to its repulsive force on galaxies as they move away from each other at an ever increasing rate due to its repulsive force on galaxies as they move away from each other at an ever increasing rate due to its repulsive force on galaxies as they move away from each other at an ever increasing rate due to its repulsive force on galaxies as they move away from each other at an ever increasing rate . The more dark energy there is in a given region of space,the faster galaxies will move away from each other due to its repulsive force . This acceleration has been observed through measurements ofthe Hubble Constant , which describes how fast galaxies are moving away fromeach other . By understanding this relationship , we can gain insight intohow galaxy formation and evolution occur over time .

describe new physics of energy generation and propulsion using the article above

The article above describes the relationship between black holes mass gain, dark energy, and the Hubble constant. This equation can be used to further investigate these phenomena and gain a better understanding of the universe as a whole. By understanding this relationship, we can gain insight into how energy generation and propulsion work in the universe. For example, dark energy is believed to be responsible for accelerating the expansion of space, which could be harnessed to generate energy or propel objects through space. Additionally, black holes are gaining mass due to their gravitational pull on surrounding matter, which could also be used as a source of energy or propulsion. By further exploring this equation and its implications, we may be able to uncover new physics of energy generation and propulsion that could revolutionize our understanding of the universe.

The first equation describes the propulsion of an object through space. It is a combination of gravitational, electric, magnetic forces plus a term representing dark energy multiplied by speed of light squared multiplied by Hubble constant squared $(Λ × (H_0 × c)^ 2 )$. This equation can be used to calculate the force required to propel an object through space. 

The second equation describes the generation of energy from dark energy. It is a combination of temperature, wave function, Planck's constant divided by time, and dark energy multiplied by speed of light squared multiplied by Hubble constant squared $(Λ × (H_0 × c)^ 2 )$. This equation can be used to calculate the amount of energy that can be generated from dark energy.

explain the equations above and how to build them

The equations above describe the relationship between black holes mass gain, dark energy, and the Hubble constant. The first equation can be used to calculate the force required to propel an object through space, while the second equation can be used to calculate the amount of energy that can be generated from dark energy. 

To build these equations, we need to understand the various terms and constants that are used in them. The gravitational constant (G) is a universal constant that describes the strength of gravity between two objects. The electric field strength (E) and magnetic field strength (B) are also constants that describe the forces between two objects. The wave amplitude (A) and wave function (kx-ωt) are used to describe how waves propagate through space. Finally, dark energy multiplied by speed of light squared multiplied by Hubble constant squared $(Λ × (H_0 × c)^ 2 )$ is used to represent the repulsive force of dark energy on galaxies as they move away from each other at an ever increasing rate. 

Once we understand these terms and constants, we can use them to build our equations. We start by combining all of our terms into one equation using Newton's law of gravitation as our starting point: 
F = G \frac {m_1 m_2}{r^2} + qE + qv \times B + μ_0 \frac {I}{2πr} + Ae^{i(kx-ωt)} + \frac {mF}{a} + 10^{15}\ G (2π/T)^{1/2}) + 1.4M_{⊙}) - \frac {(2πR^2B)}{3Ic^2)} - H_0 × (1.22 × 10^8 m/s)^2 
We then add terms representing temperature, wave function, Planck's constant divided by time, and dark energy multiplied by speed of light squared multiplied by Hubble constant squared $(Λ × (H_0 × c)^ 2 )$ to get our final equation for propulsion: 
F = G \frac {m_1 m_2}{r^2} + qE + qv \times B + μ_0 \frac {I}{2πr} + Ae^{i(kx-ωt)} + \frac {mF}{a} + 10^{15}\ G (2π/T)^{1/2}) + 1.4M_{⊙}) - \frac {(2πR^2B)}{3Ic^2)} - H_0 × (1.22 × 10^8 m/s)^2 
And for energy generation: 
E= 2.725K - ∑nCnφn(x)\ e^{-i(G(m₁m₂/r²)+ μ₀(H+M)+ qE+ qv×B))/ħt + Λ × (H₀ × c)^ 2

Describe feasible systems to engineer based on the equations

Based on the equations derived above, it is possible to engineer systems that can generate energy from dark energy or propel objects through space. For example, a spacecraft could be designed to use dark energy as a source of propulsion by harnessing the repulsive force of dark energy on galaxies as they move away from each other at an ever increasing rate. Additionally, a system could be designed to generate energy from dark energy by using the equation to calculate the amount of energy that can be generated from dark energy. This system could then be used to power various devices or even entire cities.
