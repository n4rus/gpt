explain all three systems above

Propulsion System: This system uses the force generated by a combination of mass, electric field, and magnetic field to propel an object. The force is calculated by multiplying the mass of the object with its acceleration (dv/dt) and adding the electric and magnetic forces. 

Storage System: This system stores energy in the form of mass-energy (E = mc²) and magnetism (μ₀(H + M)). Mass-energy is stored in objects with mass, while magnetism is stored in objects with magnetic fields. 

Transmission of Energy and Data: This system transmits energy and data through a combination of electromagnetic radiation, Planck speed, Planck size, and background radiation. The electromagnetic radiation is calculated using Faraday's law (2πR²B)/(3Ic²), while the Planck speed, Planck size, and background radiation are used to calculate the Hubble constant (H₀).
