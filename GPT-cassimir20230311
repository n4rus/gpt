relate M-theory and cassimir effect with equations

The Cassimir effect is a quantum mechanical force that arises between two uncharged, parallel, and closely spaced conducting plates due to the fluctuations of the quantum vacuum. This force is described by the equation:

F_c = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar c A}{240 d^4} 

where F_c is the force, \hbar is Planck's constant divided by 2\pi, c is the speed of light, A is the area of each plate, and d is the distance between them. 

M-theory is a theory in physics that unifies all five string theories and 11 dimensions of space-time into one framework. It can be described mathematically using equations such as the 11-dimensional supergravity equations: 
R_{MNPQ} = \frac{1}{2} (\partial_M G_{NPQ} - \partial_N G_{MPQ} + \partial_P G_{MNQ} - \partial_Q G_{MNP}) 
where R_{MNPQ} are components of the Riemann curvature tensor and G_{MNP} are components of the metric tensor.
