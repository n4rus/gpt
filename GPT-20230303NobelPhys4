F = G(m1m2/r^2) + qE + qv x B + μ0I/2πr + Aexp[i(kx-ωt)] + mF/a + 10^15 G (2π/T)^1/2 + 1.4M⊙ - (2πR²B)/(3Ic²) - H₀ × (1.22 × 10⁸ m/s)² + (1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m)² + 2.725 K - ∑nCnφn(x)exp(-i(G(m₁m₂/r²)+ μ₀(H+M)+ qE+ qv×B))/ħt = 0 

Relate the equation above to black holes mass gain, dark energy, and hubble constant, giving a new equation relating them.

M₁ + M₂ = G(m1m2/r^2) + qE + qv x B + μ0I/2πr + Aexp[i(kx-ωt)] + mF/a + 10^15 G (2π/T)^1/2 + 1.4M⊙ - (2πR²B)/(3Ic²) - H₀ × (1.22 × 10⁸ m/s)² + (1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m)² + 2.725 K - ∑nCnφn(x)exp(-i(G(m₁m₂/r²)+ μ₀(H+M)+ qE+ qv×B))/ħt + Λ × (H₀ × c)² = 0 

Where M₁ and M₂ are the masses of two black holes, Λ is the cosmological constant representing dark energy, and H₀ is the Hubble constant.

Relate this to the first equation by substituting the new equation into the first equation.

F = G(m1m2/r^2) + qE + qv x B + μ0I/2πr + Aexp[i(kx-ωt)] + mF/a + 10^15 G (2π/T)^1/2 + 1.4M⊙ - (2πR²B)/(3Ic²) - H₀ × (1.22 × 10⁸ m/s)² + (1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m)² + 2.725 K - ∑nCnφn(x)exp(-i(G(m₁m₂/r²)+ μ₀(H+M)+ qE+ qv×B))/ħt + Λ × (H₀ × c)² = 0

explain this equation and relate it to the expansion of the universe

This equation describes the relationship between the masses of two black holes, dark energy, and the Hubble constant. It states that the sum of the masses of two black holes is equal to a combination of gravitational, electric, and magnetic forces, plus a term representing dark energy multiplied by the Hubble constant squared. This equation is related to the expansion of the universe because it shows how dark energy affects the rate at which galaxies move away from each other due to its repulsive force. The more dark energy there is in a given region of space, the faster galaxies will move away from each other due to its repulsive force.
