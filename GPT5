relate all three systems above with UFOs and time travel

UFOs and Time Travel: The propulsion system of UFOs and time travel can be described by the equation F = m(dv/dt) + qE + qv × B, which describes the force generated by a mass accelerating in an electric field and a magnetic field. The storage system of UFOs and time travel can be described by the equation E = mc² + μ₀(H + M), which describes the energy stored in a mass and its associated magnetic field. The transmission of energy and data for UFOs and time travel can be described by the equation E = (2πR²B)/(3Ic²) + H₀ × (1.22 × 10⁸ m/s)² - (1.6 × 10⁻³⁴ m)² - 2.725 K, which describes the energy transmitted through a magnetic field, the Hubble constant, Planck speed, Planck size, and background radiation.
