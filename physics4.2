print equations for magnetism, gravity, energy, quantum fields, mass, solar spots, magnetars, pulsars, neutron stars, and electromagnetism.

Magnetism: F = qv x B 
Gravity: F = G(m1m2/r^2) 
Energy: E = mc^2 
Quantum Fields: ψ(x,t) = Aexp[i(kx-ωt)] 
Mass: m = F/a 
Solar Spots: B = μ0I/2πr 
Magnetars: B ≈ 10^15 G 
Pulsars: P = (2π/T)^1/2 
Neutron Stars: M ≈ 1.4M⊙ 
Electromagnetism: F = qE + qv x B

relate all equations above in a new single equation

F = G(m1m2/r^2) + qE + qv x B + μ0I/2πr + Aexp[i(kx-ωt)] + mF/a + 10^15 G (2π/T)^1/2 + 1.4M⊙
