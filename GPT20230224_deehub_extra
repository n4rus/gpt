make a code for an android app that hubs ifood, uber, and rappi for drives to select the rides orders they want to take by price and distance.

//Create a new Android project 
public class RideOrderSelector extends Activity {

    //Declare variables 
    private double price;
    private double distance;

    //Create a method to select the ride orders by price and distance 
    public void selectRideOrder(double price, double distance) {

        //Check if the price is within the range of Ifood, Uber, and Rappi 
        if (price >= 0 && price <= 10) {

            //Check if the distance is within the range of Ifood, Uber, and Rappi 
            if (distance >= 0 && distance <= 10) {

                //If both conditions are met, display a list of available rides from Ifood, Uber, and Rappi 
                System.out.println("Available rides from Ifood, Uber, and Rappi:");

                //Display list of available rides from Ifood 
                System.out.println("Ifood:");

                //Display list of available rides from Uber 
                System.out.println("Uber:");

                //Display list of available rides from Rappi 
                System.out.println("Rappi:");

            } else {

                //If the distance is not within the range of Ifood, Uber, and Rappi display an error message 
                System.out.println("Error: Distance not within range.");

            }

        } else {

            //If the price is not within the range of Ifood, Uber, and Rappi display an error message  
            System.out.println("Error: Price not within range.");

        }  
    }  
}
