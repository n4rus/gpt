explain the equation

This equation relates the forces of magnetism, gravity, mass, and quantum fields. The first term is the gravitational force between two masses, m₁ and m₂, divided by the square of the distance between them. The second term is the force due to a charged particle's velocity multiplied by a magnetic field. The third term is the magnetic force due to a magnetic field (H) and a magnetization (M). The fourth term is a summation of quantum fields with coefficients Cn and wave functions φn(x) multiplied by an exponential factor. Finally, the fifth term is Newton's second law of motion which states that force equals mass times acceleration.
