The equation for propulsion combines the equations for magnetism, gravity, energy, quantum fields, mass, solar spots, magnetars, pulsars, neutron stars, electromagnetism and m-theory. It is a combination of forces and energies that can be used to propel an object. The equation is: Propulsion = (2πR²B)/(3Ic²) + qE + qv × B + μ₀(H + M) - (m c) ² + F/a + E = mc². This equation takes into account the magnetic force generated by a magnetic field (B), the gravitational force between two masses (F), the energy of an object (E), the quantum fields that govern particle behavior (ψ), the mass of an object (m), the strength of solar spots (Bs), the strength of magnetars (B), the rotational period of a pulsar (P), the mass of a neutron star (M⊙), the electric force generated by an electric field and a moving charge (qE+qv×B) and finally m-theory which relates energy and momentum in special relativity ((m c) ²). All these forces and energies are combined to create a propulsion system that can be used to move an object.
