Once we understand these terms and constants, we can use them to build our equations. We start by combining all of our terms into one equation using Newton's law of gravitation as our starting point: 
F = G \frac {m_1 m_2}{r^2} + qE + qv \times B + μ_0 \frac {I}{2πr} + Ae^{i(kx-ωt)} + \frac {mF}{a} + 10^{15}\ G (2π/T)^{1/2}) + 1.4M_{⊙}) - \frac {(2πR^2B)}{3Ic^2)} - H_0 × (1.22 × 10^8 m/s)^2 
We then add terms representing temperature, wave function, Planck's constant divided by time, and dark energy multiplied by speed of light squared multiplied by Hubble constant squared $(Λ × (H_0 × c)^ 2 )$ to get our final equation for propulsion: 
F = G \frac {m_1 m_2}{r^2} + qE + qv \times B + μ_0 \frac {I}{2πr} + Ae^{i(kx-ωt)} + \frac {mF}{a} + 10^{15}\ G (2π/T)^{1/2}) + 1.4M_{⊙}) - \frac {(2πR^2B)}{3Ic^2)} - H_0 × (1.22 × 10^8 m/s)^2 
And for energy generation: 
E= 2.725K - ∑nCnφn(x)\ e^{-i(G(m₁m₂/r²)+ μ₀(H+M)+ qE+ qv×B))/ħt + Λ × (H₀ × c)^ 2

Describe feasible systems to engineer based on the equations

Based on the equations derived above, it is possible to engineer systems that can generate energy from dark energy or propel objects through space. For example, a spacecraft could be designed to use dark energy as a source of propulsion by harnessing the repulsive force of dark energy on galaxies as they move away from each other at an ever increasing rate. Additionally, a system could be designed to generate energy from dark energy by using the equation to calculate the amount of energy that can be generated from dark energy. This system could then be used to power various devices or even entire cities. Finally, a system could be designed to use the equation to calculate the amount of energy that can be generated from a combination of gravitational, electric, magnetic, and wave forces. This system could then be used to power various devices or even entire cities.

Describe how to build a prototype or experiment to test the hypotesis

To test the hypothesis that dark energy can be used as a source of propulsion or energy generation, a prototype or experiment could be built. The first step would be to create a model of the system that is being tested. This model should include all of the necessary components such as a source of dark energy, a gravitational field, an electric field, a magnetic field, and wave forces. Once the model is created, it can then be tested by measuring the amount of energy generated or propulsion achieved when different parameters are changed. For example, the amount of dark energy used in the system could be varied to see how it affects the amount of energy generated or propulsion achieved. Additionally, different combinations of gravitational, electric, magnetic and wave forces could be tested to see how they affect the amount of energy generated or propulsion achieved. Finally, experiments could also be conducted to measure how dark energy interacts with other forms of matter and energy in order to gain further insight into its properties and behavior.

that's not enough, give equations on how to obtain dark energy based on the content above

The equation for obtaining dark energy based on the content above is: 
E = Λ × (H₀ × c)^2 
where Λ is the cosmological constant, H₀ is the Hubble constant, and c is the speed of light. This equation can be used to calculate the amount of energy that can be generated from dark energy.
