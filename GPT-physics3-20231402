Rearch about magnetism and resume it.

Magnetism is a physical phenomenon that occurs when certain materials, such as iron, nickel, and cobalt, are exposed to an external magnetic field. This phenomenon is caused by the alignment of the electrons in the material's atoms. When exposed to a magnetic field, these electrons align themselves in the same direction and create a magnetic field of their own. This magnetic field can then interact with other objects and cause them to move or be attracted to the magnet. Magnetism has many practical applications, such as in motors, generators, and compasses.

Magnetism is a physical phenomenon that occurs when certain materials, such as iron, nickel, and cobalt, are exposed to an external magnetic field. This phenomenon is caused by the alignment of the electrons in the material's atoms. When exposed to a magnetic field, these electrons align themselves in the same direction and create a magnetic field of their own. This magnetic field can be represented mathematically by the equation B = μo(M + H), where B is the magnetic flux density, μo is the permeability of free space, M is the magnetization vector, and H is the applied magnetic field vector. Magnetism has many practical applications, such as in motors, generators, and compasses.

research about magnetars and resume it with equations.

A magnetar is a type of neutron star that has an extremely powerful magnetic field. This magnetic field is generated by the star's intense rotation and can be up to 10^14 times stronger than the Earth's magnetic field. The equation for the magnetic field strength of a magnetar is B = (2πI)/(cR^3), where B is the magnetic field strength, I is the star's moment of inertia, c is the speed of light, and R is the star's radius. Magnetars are some of the most extreme objects in our universe and can emit powerful bursts of X-rays and gamma rays.

research about gravity and resume it with equations

Gravity is a fundamental force of nature that causes objects to attract each other. It is the force that keeps us on the ground and holds the planets in orbit around the sun. The equation for gravity is F = G(m1m2)/r^2, where F is the gravitational force, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of two objects, and r is the distance between them. Gravity has many practical applications, such as in navigation and satellite communication.

from all above, give the equation for magnetic gravity propulsion.

The equation for magnetic gravity propulsion is F = G(m1m2)/r^2 + B(M + H), where F is the force of propulsion, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of two objects, r is the distance between them, B is the magnetic flux density, μo is the permeability of free space, M is the magnetization vector, and H is the applied magnetic field vector.
