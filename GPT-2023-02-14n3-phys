Rearch about magnetism and resume it.

Magnetism is a force of attraction or repulsion that acts between objects containing certain materials, such as iron. It is caused by the motion of electric charges and is responsible for many phenomena, such as the behavior of electric motors and the Earth's magnetic field. Magnetism can also be used to store information in magnetic media, such as hard disks and tapes. The study of magnetism is known as magnetics.

Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object. It is related to weight, which is a measure of the force of gravity on an object. The equation for mass is m = F/a, where m is mass, F is force, and a is acceleration. Mass can also be expressed in terms of energy using the equation E = mc2, where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light.
